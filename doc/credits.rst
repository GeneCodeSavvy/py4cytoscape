Contributions
-------------

This section aims to provide a list of people and projects that have
contributed to ``py4cytoscape``. It is intended to be an *inclusive* list, and
anyone who has contributed and wishes to make that contribution known is
welcome to add an entry into this file.  Generally, no name should be added to
this list without the approval of the person associated with that name.

Creating a comprehensive list of contributors can be difficult, and the list
within this file is almost certainly incomplete.  Contributors include
testers, bug reporters, contributors who wish to remain anonymous, funding
sources, academic advisors, end users, and even build/integration systems.

this file and add your name. If you do not have commit access, feel free to
open an `issue <https://github.com/bdemchak/py4cytoscape/issues/new>`_, submit a
`pull request <https://github.com/bdemchak/py4cytoscape/compare/>`_, or get in
