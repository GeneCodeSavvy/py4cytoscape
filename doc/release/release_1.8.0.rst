Announcement: py4cytoscape 1.8.0
---------------------------------

We're happy to announce the release of py4cytoscape 1.8.0!

py4cytoscape is a Python package that communicates with `Cytoscape <https://cytoscape.org>`_
via its `REST API <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31477170/>`_, providing access to a set over 250 functions that
enable control of Cytoscape from within standalone and Notebook Python programming environments. It provides
nearly identical functionality to `RCy3 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6880260/>`_, an R package in
Bioconductor available to R programmers.
