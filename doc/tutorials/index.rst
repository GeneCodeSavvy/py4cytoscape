Quick Start
-----------

The quickest way to see py4cytoscape in action is via the `Overview of py4cytoscape <https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/Python/Overview-of-py4cytoscape.ipynb>`_ Jupyter-based workflow.

You can avoid installing Python or py4cytoscape by clicking on the *Open in Colab* button, and running the Python workflow in the Google Cloud, though you will still have to install Cytoscape on your workstation.

You can follow the notes in the Jupyter Notebook as the workflow automates Cytoscape execution.

General Tutorials
-----------------

A broad set of Cytoscape Automation samples and tutorials is available
on the `Cytoscape Automation for Python scripters <https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python>`_.

You can try the samples and tutorials not only on the (local Cytoscape + local Python environment)
but also on the (local Cytoscape Desktop + remote `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/>`_).

1. Install Cytoscape in your local desktop environment and launch it.

2. Click on the "Open in Colab" badge in the samples and tutorials
