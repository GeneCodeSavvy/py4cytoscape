A broad set of Cytoscape Automation Jupyter notebooks are available
on the `Cytoscape Automation for Python scripters <https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/tree/master/for-scripters/Python>`_.

We recommend you to try the `Overview-of-py4cytoscape.ipynb <https://github.com/cytoscape/cytoscape-automation/blob/master/for-scripters/Python/Overview-of-py4cytoscape.ipynb>`_ first.

You have two options to try the notebooks.

1. is (LOCAL Cytoscape + LOCAL Jupyter environment).
2. is (LOCAL Cytoscape + REMOTE Jupyter environment [for example Google Colab]).

If you want to try the latter, click on the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of each notebook (ipynb file).
